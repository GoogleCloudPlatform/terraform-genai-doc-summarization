      tagline: Create summaries of a large corpus of documents using Generative AI.
      detailed: |-
        This solution showcases how to summarize a large corpus of documents using Generative AI. It provides an
        end-to-end demonstration of document summarization going all the way from raw documents, detecting text
        in the documents and summarizing the documents on-demand using Vertex AI LLM APIs, Cloud Vision Optical
        Character Recognition (OCR) and BigQuery.
      preDeploy: To deploy this blueprint you must have an active billing account and billing permissions.

        - 1. The developer follows a tutorial on a Jupyter Notebook, where they upload a PDF — either through Vertex AI Workbench or Colaboratory.
        - 2. The uploaded PDF file is sent to a function running on Cloud Functions. This function handles PDF file processing.
        - 3. The Cloud Functions function uses Cloud Vision to extract all text from the PDF file.
        - 4. The Cloud Functions function stores the extracted text inside a Cloud Storage bucket.
        - 5. The Cloud Functions function uses Vertex AI’s LLM API to summarize the extracted text.
        - 6. The Cloud Functions function stores the text summaries of PDFs in BigQuery tables.
        - 7. As an alternative to uploading PDF files through Jupyter Notebook, the developer can upload a PDF file directly to a Cloud Storage
        - bucket — for instance, through the Console UI or gcloud. This upload triggers Eventarc to begin the Document Processing phase.
        - 8. As a result of the direct upload to Cloud Storage, Eventarc triggers the Document Processing phase, handled by Cloud Functions.
