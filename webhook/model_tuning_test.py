Our quantum computers work by manipulating qubits in an orchestrated 
fashion that we call quantum algorithms. The challenge is that qubits 
are so sensitive that even stray light can cause calculation errors 
— and the problem worsens as quantum computers grow. This has significant 
consequences, since the best quantum algorithms that we know for running 
useful applications require the error rates of our qubits to be far lower 
than we have today. To bridge this gap, we will need quantum error correction. 
Quantum error correction protects information by encoding it across 
multiple physical qubits to form a “logical qubit,” and is believed to be 
the only way to produce a large-scale quantum computer with error rates 
low enough for useful calculations. Instead of computing on the individual 
qubits themselves, we will then compute on logical qubits. By encoding 
larger numbers of physical qubits on our quantum processor into one 
logical qubit, we hope to reduce the error rates to enable useful 
quantum algorithms.
